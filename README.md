#Purpose
The purpose of OMSA is to enable simple integrations between different public transport booking and reservation systems. OMSA was designed to enable actors to utilize open data from the National Access Points, to create value for themselves and for the travellers. OMSA aspires to be a tool for actors that want to collaborate on booking and reservation, and thereby lower the costs integration across the sector. OMSA is based on the premise of a distributed eco-system, where existing services, solutions, components and standards are re-used and re-purposed to create value for the players in the industry. Under the premise of "no need to re-invent the wheel", OMSA aims to add the value of collaboration and integration without the need for sizeable up-front investments.
